# ieee-css

A stylesheet to make IEEE format papers in HTML, copied from the IEEE A4 Conference Template for Word. Thankfully IEEE doesn't actually accept this but this may help you for random college things. Make an issue if you'd like something fixed or added.

## Usage

Download `ieee.css` and add it to your HTML file. This uses a combination of semantic structuring and classes for styling, see the example `index.html` for reference.

To export, save as PDF from your browser's print dialog.
